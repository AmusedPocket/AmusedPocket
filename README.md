### :computer: Hello and welcome! :computer:

My name is Trevor Irving and I am a recently (returning) Software Engineer, after 11 years of experience in the Food Safety / Quality Assurance world. 

Recently I graduated from :school: App Academy :school: from their full-stack software engineer bootcamp, and I am looking at being a software developer professionally. With the ability to quickly disseminate information, read and apply documentation I will be able to hit the ground running for my next company! :fire:
